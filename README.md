# ethereum-login




Allow users to authenticate themselves to your websites and apps  without relying on a centralized corporation such as Google, Twitter or Facebook.  Instead, users can use an Ethereum account that they control and authenticate with the web3.js library.

Those users will need to use a plugin such as Metamask or a browser such as Mist in order to authenticate themselves in this way.  However, there are many advantages including:

* Accept payments easily via the Ethereum network
* No need to locally store user passwords, only sessions
* No need to include 'reset password' functions
* No need to store API keys for Oauth services
* No reliance on an external corporation whose API could go down at any time, grinding your app to a halt
